Sample code
1. Adding geometrical information
2. Polygonizing raster files to esri shapefile (can be translated to other types easily)
3. Filling holes + shrinking polygons a bit (for small connectors removal)
4. Simplifying polygons
5. Adding features (areas + number of vertices/points) to each polygon
6. Classifying polygons using rule-based algorithms (areas and vertices)
3-6: single file
